# passwordGenerator

https://dmcc789.github.io/passwordGenerator/

This browser-based application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.  It has dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.  It features a clean user interface and is responsive.  

An employee with access to sensitive data wants to randomly generate a password so that they are able to create a strong and secure password.  This finished application meets the needs of the user by prompting the user for desired criteria and returning a random password at their desired length. 

I could definitely streamline the code more but was up against the clock to get something that functioned.  Thanks for any feedback you have for me for improvement!
